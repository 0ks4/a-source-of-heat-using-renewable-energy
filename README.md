The market has many heating systems witch using renewable energy sources.
Like solar collectors and water circulation fireplaces which circulates produces hot water from the heat source to the central heating boiler.

Main idea behind this project is made low operating costs application which monitor water circulation fireplace pipelines temperature difference to calculate system cumulative electricity saving in kWh per year.
The final data processing can be done by example raspberry pi (java or python) or in Arduino (c).
I have not decided yet.
